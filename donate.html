                <p>We also intent to run an online substance- abuse survivors' forum and a single- mother forum, respectively, which will provide a safe place for drug abuse survivors amd single mothers to receive help.</p>

                <p>Offline, we give presentations about substance abuse, run substance- abuse awareness campaigns, help schools establish effective substance-abuse prevention and anti-bullying strategies, visit and call substance-abuse survivors, and assist individuals with addiction problems.</p>
                
                <p>We also work extensively with the press, responding to numerous press inquiries and providing them with interviews, which helps us educate the press, and ultimately the general public, about substance abuse.</p>
